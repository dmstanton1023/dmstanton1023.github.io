Dear Heavenly Father,I come to confess that I am a sinner, deserving of your judgement and punishment. Lord I want to repent of my sins and surrender my life to You. Wash me clean. I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. That He died on the cross for my sins and rose again on the third day, so thaat I may have eternal life. I believe that in my heart and make confession with my mouth, that Jesus is my Savior and Lord. I pray these thing in Jesus name, Amen.
