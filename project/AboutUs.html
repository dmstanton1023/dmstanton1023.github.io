            <h2><u>The Gospel</u></h2>
            <p class="about-us">
                Romans 6:23<br>
                For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
                <br>
                <br>
                Romans 3:23-24<br>
                for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus
                <br>
                <br>
                Ephesians 2:8-9 <br>
                For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.
                <br>
                <br>
                John 3:16-21<br>
                “For  God so loved  the world,   that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not  perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.”
